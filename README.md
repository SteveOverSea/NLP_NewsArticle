# Analysing a News Article with Sentiment Analysis API

## Specification

This project is part of the Udacity Front End Dev Nanodegree.
For the whole project should use Webpack and other tools like loaders, sass, minifiers, optimiziers, jest-tests and also service workers.

## Structure

In the root directory are all the config files for jest-Tests, babel-, webpack-configurations (one for production and for development), also there are hidden files (not in the repo) for storing the API-key as environment variable with dotenv.
Then you see the server and client side of the projects. CSS is written in SASS and converted to CSS by webpack loaders. Javascript gets converted to ES5 with babel-loader.
